## Project Part 3 Feedback

### Code Base

The code is well organized. I experiencied no isses running the app. All required features for the milestone were present. Good validation is present.

### Documentation

Not all files have comments describing the purpose and role of it. Models do not have documentation for all methods. Otherwise, the docs  and comments that are present are good.

### Test Cases

Some unit tests are present, but mostly test getters and setters. Unless your getters and setters have logic in them, I would not waste time on adding these tests. You have good candidate methods for unit tests, like the validateFields method in the SignupFragment. You just might need to move the method to make testing easier. 

### Object Oriented Design

Some cardinalities are missing. Diagram is well organized and clearly labeled.  All classes are present in the diagram.

### Backlog

Backlog is clear and up to date.

### Sprint Planning and Review

Sprint planning looks good, but could have some more details. For example, there was an issue that was archived. Why is this the case?

### Demo 

Demo was smooth and all features worked.

### Tool Use

Issues should have descriptions. Make sure to assign yourself to PRs, write a description, and not to merge the PR until someone approves it.

### General Feedback

Code and diagrams are well organized. UI looks good. All tasks were completed. Keep up the good work.
