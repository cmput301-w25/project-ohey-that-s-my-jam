## Project Part 4 Feedback

### Final Grade

8/8

### Feedback From Project Part 3

Feedback was addresed.

### Code Base

All requirements completed and code base is well organized. Data validation is present.

### Documentation

Some models are missing Javadocs and could be extended with more descriptions. Some classes are missing discriptions about what they do.

### Test Cases

Tests were far more extensive than in the previous project part. It would be beneficial if you indicated which tests cover which user stories.

### Object Oriented Design

Fragments have a composition relationship with activities and should have cardinalities to match this. Some relationships are missing, like signup and login should have relationships with the user manager.

### Backlog

Backlog is up to date.

### UI and Storyboard

UI was updated for new features and changes.

### Sprint Planning and Review

Comprehensive sprint plan and meeting notes are present.

### Demo 

Should have had setup demo data, and the demo could use some more rehersal. There was also a lack of visual connection with the audience.

### Tool Use

Some PRs have asignees, but others are missing them. Make sure to give the PRs good descriptions. For example, if you revert a previous commit/merge you should explain why.

### Relative Quality

UI is easy to use and follows consitent design. App flow is good. Implementation of features was well thought out and to a high caliber.
